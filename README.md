photoMag


This is a website for a magazine called PhotoMag. 

There is an administrative part of the side where you can put in new content for the customers part of the website. 
The website will contain information, tutorials ( through youtube) and other cozy stuff. 


OBS! 

This is a school project and we are not focusing on the design in this particular project, so excuse me for irritating your eyes.
